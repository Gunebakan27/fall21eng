 * 3)"ProtectedClass" members can be used by child classes,

 * 5)To use "Static" class members, no need to create object, use them by class name.
 * 6)super() is for calling parent constructor.
 * If you dont type super() inside the constructor, java will put it as default but it will be invisible
 * 7)super() must be in the first line inside the constructor.
 * 8)"this()" and "super()" must be in the first line inside a constructor so they can not be used at the same time in a constructor.
 * 9)A child class cannot have multiple parents
